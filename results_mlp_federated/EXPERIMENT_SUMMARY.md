## CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED
### 1. Deterministic Seeding (SHA256)
- FIXED: Replaced hash() with SHA256 for true reproducibility
- No more random salt between Python runs
- Deterministic region-specific seeds guaranteed

### 2. Proper Imputation Order
- FIXED: Removed fillna(0) that polluted global medians
- Only use global medians for consistent imputation
- No zero contamination in missing column handling

### 3. Correct Region-Weight Logging
- FIXED: Proper alignment of regions and weights in logs
- Track trained_regions list to prevent mismatched logging
- No more misleading weight assignments

### 4. Truly Balanced Warm-up
- FIXED: Uses minimum class count for true balance
- Equal samples per class regardless of original distribution
- Reduces variance in initial training steps

### 5. Weighted ROC-AUC with NaN Handling
- FIXED: Re-normalizes weights for non-NaN values
- Proper handling when some regions have single-class test sets
- No more weight loss due to NaN propagation

### 6. Deterministic Template Selection
- FIXED: Uses alphabetically first region for template
- Removes hidden source of non-determinism
- Consistent across different OS/filesystem orders

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling
- SMOTE fallback to RandomOverSampler
- Safe metrics calculation with zero_division guards
- Zero-weight protection in aggregation
- Auto-discovery of regional datasets
- Oversampling ratio logging
